I am excited to present my project on HR Attrition Analysis conducted with Meriskill. Throughout this project, I applied my expertise in Data Analytics, leveraging Power BI tools to create insightful visualizations.
Key tasks included:
•	Data Transformation (Cleaning)
•	Removal of duplicates
•	Renaming of columns
•	Handling NaN values to prepare for further analysis
In terms of Data Visualization:
•	Developed correlation maps for various factors such as Marital Status, Overtime, Job Role, Gender, Department, Business Travel, and Education Field.
•	Explored relationships such as Overtime versus Age, Total Working Years, Education Level, Number of Companies Worked, and Distance from Home.
Tools used:
•	Power BI
•	Microsoft Excel
Key Insights:
•	Total employees: 1470, with 1233 currently active and 237 having left (total attrition).
•	The highest attrition rates were observed among employees aged 31 to 45, with a notable gender disparity favoring males.
•	53.59% of employees reported good work-life balance, while 10.55% reported bad work-life balance.
•	There is an imbalance in gender distribution, with 63% male employees and 37% female employees.
•	Performance analysis indicated a low performance rate of 84.39% and a high performance rate of 15%.
•	The Research and Development department had the highest employee representation at 56.12%, while the Sales department was notably lower at 5.06%.
